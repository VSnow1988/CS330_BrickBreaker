# CS330_BrickBreaker
CS330 SNHU week 8 project: Brick-Breaker with OpenGL

A brick-breaker stylee game.
Uses vectors to hold balls and bricks and draw them on-screen.
Colors are random shades of purple. I sure love purple.

How to Play:
Run program and use space bar to launch a ball in a random direction.
Balls will coollide with bricks or each other and cause colors to change or bricks to disappear and rebound.
